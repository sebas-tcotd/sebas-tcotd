# **Hi there! 👋😄**

Hi everyone, I'm Sebastian Vargas, a Software Engineering student. Actually, I'm learning so at Mayor National University of San Marcos, in Peru. 🇵🇪

## Some words about me

I'm majoring myself into Web Development; being more accurate, Front-End Development 👨🏻‍💻

I also have UX/UI skills and I like everything about that. Maybe I could be a Product Designer in the future, I don't rule out that option. 

Besides web development, I like doing other things like:

- Sing 🎤
- Photography 📸
- Writing 📖✍🏻
- Play my quena 🎶

I always try to grow and learn something new. I spend time off watching videos on YouTube, doing my hobbies above or trying to learn a new language (not necessarily a programming language 😅).
