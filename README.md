# **Hi there! 👋😄**

Hi everyone, I'm Sebastian Vargas, a Software Engineer. At present, I am a graduate from there at Mayor National University of San Marcos, in Peru. 🇵🇪

## Some words about me

I'm a Front-End developer who likes to do high-quality, good projects. Currently, I'm working at that. 👨🏻‍💻
I like Design, UX/UI topics too. When I'm not doing front-end stuff, I'm doing things related to design. 🎨

This is my place where generally I store my side-projects, like a sanctuary for my work and experimental ideas.

Besides web development, I like doing other things like:

- Sing 🎤
- Photography 📸
- Writing 📖✍🏻
- Play my quena 🎶

I always try to grow and learn something new. I spend time off reading a book, doing my hobbies above or trying to learn some human languages. 🗺
